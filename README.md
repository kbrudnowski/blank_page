# blank_page - Continuous Writing Challenge
Welcome to the Continuous Writing Challenge, a unique online text editor designed to help writers overcome writer's block and encourage continuous writing. This project aims to offer an engaging and fun experience that pushes writers to keep their creative juices flowing.

## Introduction
For many writers, facing the dreaded writer's block is an all-too-familiar challenge. The Continuous Writing Challenge is an experimental solution to this problem, where the website motivates users to write without stopping. If the user pauses for more than 5 seconds, the entire written content will be wiped clean, adding a sense of urgency to maintain a consistent flow of writing.

## Features
Minimalistic Interface: The web application offers a clean and straightforward interface, allowing writers to focus solely on their writing.
Real-time Countdown: A visible countdown timer starts whenever the user begins typing. If no new content is added within the last 5 seconds, the timer triggers an automatic clearing of the text area.
Encouraging Message: The page displays a motivating message to keep the writer going, emphasizing the importance of continuous writing.
